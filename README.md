Question 1: Correct<p>
Question 2: Looks good.<p>
Question 3: Looks good.<p>
Question 4: Great<p>
Question 5: Kable here would have made the table prettier but this works.<p>
Question 6: This one didn't work. I think the main issue is you still needed to summarise the data to state level and couldn't figure that part out. The ggplot would have likely been easier had you gotten this.<p>
Question 7: See response to Q6.<p>
Bonus: NA

General comments: I'll mark this as complete, but obviously the last question gave you trouble. I feel like you gave it a good faith effort. Happy to talk through how you might have addressed that if you want.
